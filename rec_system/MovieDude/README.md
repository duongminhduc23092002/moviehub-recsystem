# MovieDude ![Movie Recommendation System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Movie%20Recommendation%20System-orange?style=flat-square)

An advanced "content-based filtering" movie recommendation system built with Python, scikit-learn, and SQLite.<br>
It provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences through data analysis, and also allows users to search by a specific movie title or keyword to find similar recommendations.
<br>
The current demo utilizes a pre-processed dataset of the top 6,000 [TMDB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies) movies.

### Workflow Sections:
- <strong>On Users Table Flow </strong>>>><br>
  Extract and analyze user activity data from the database to determine personal preferences.
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Apply Min–Max data normalization</li>
    <li>Extract top favorite movies by normalized score</li>
    <li>Use quasi-NLP to extract movie attributes</li>
    <li>Return final result processed matrix ready for model use</li>
  </ol>
- <strong>Main Engine Processes</strong> >>><br>
  Performs similarity analysis and recommendation generation based on user preferences and the database contents.

  <ol type="1">
    <li>Apply selected options #1 (filter out watched movies)</li>
    <li>Pre-processing validation check</li>
    <li>Multi-binary encoding</li>
    <li>Execute engine process</li>
    <li>Apply selected options #2 (filter for high-rated movies)</li>
    <li>Return final result as a list (array)</li>
  </ol>
